## Lab 5


1) Implement a circular queue of integers. Include functions insertcq, deletecq and displaycq.


2) Implement two circular queues of integers in a single array where first queue will run from 0 to N/2 and second queue will run from N/2+1 to N-1 where N is the size of the array.


3) Implement a queue with two stacks without transferring the elements of the second stack back to stack one. (use stack1 as an input stack and stack2 as an output stack).
