## Lab 6


1) Implement an ascending priority queue.


Note: An ascending priority queue is a collection of items into which items can be inserted arbitrarily and from which only the smallest item can be removed. If apq is an ascending priority queue, the operation pqinsert(apq,x) inserts element x into apq and pqmindelete(apq) removes the minimum element from apq and returns its value.


2) Implement a queue of strings using an output restricted dequeue (no deleteRight).


Note: An output-restricted deque is one where insertion can be made at both ends, but deletion can be made from one end only, where as An input-restricted deque is one where deletion can be made from both ends, but insertion can be made at one end only.


3) Write a program to check whether given string is a palindrome using a dequeue.
