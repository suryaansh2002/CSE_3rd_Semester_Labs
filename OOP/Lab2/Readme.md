## Lab 2


1. Define a class to represent a complex number called Complex. Provide the following methods:


To assign initial values to the Complex object.
		
To display a complex number in a+ib format.
		
To add 2 complex numbers. (the return type should be Complex)
		
To subtract 2 complex numbers Write a main method to test the class.

	
2. Create a class called Time that has instance variables to represent hours, minutes and seconds. Provide the following methods:
	

To assign initial values to the Time object.
		
To display a Time object in the form of hh:mm:ss {24 hours format}
		
To add 2 Time objects (the return type should be a Time )
		
To subtract 2 Time objects (the return type should be a Time )
		
To compare 2 Time objects and to determine if they are equal or if the first is greater or smaller than the second one.
	
	
3. Consider the already defined Complex class. Provide a default constructor and parameterized constructor to this class. Also provide a display method. Illustrate all the constructors as well as the display method by defining Complex objects.
	
4. Create a class called Counter that contains a static data member to count the number of Counter objects being created. Also define a static member function called showCount() which displays the number of objects created at any given point of time. Illustrate this.
