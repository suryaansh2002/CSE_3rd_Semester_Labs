## Lab 5

1. Design an interface called Series with the following methods

getNext (returns the next number in the series)
			
reset(to restart the series)
			
setStart (to set the value from which the series should start)
		

Design two classes named ByTwos and ByFives to implement the methods of the interface Series such that it generates a series of numbers, each two/five greater than the previous one. Also design a class which will include the main method for referencing the interface.

2. Define a class CurrentDate with data members day, month and year. Define a method createDate() to create date object by reading values from keyboard. Throw a user defined exception by name InvalidDayException if the day is invalid and InvalidMonthException if month is found invalid and display current date if the date is valid. Write a test program to illustrate the functionality. 

3.Design a class Student with the methods, getNumber and putNumber to read and display the Roll No. of each student and getMarks() and putMarks() to read and display their marks. Create an interface called Sports with a method putGrade() that will display the grade obtained by a student in Sports. Design a class called Result that will implement the method putGrade() and generate the final result based on the grade in sports and the marks obtained from the superclass Student. Include appropriate instance variables for the classes.
