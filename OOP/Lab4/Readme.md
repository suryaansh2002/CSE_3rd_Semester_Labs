## Lab 4


1. Create a Person class with private instance variables for the person’s name and birth date. Add appropriate accessor methods for these variables. Then create a subclass College Graduate with private instance variables for the student’s GPA and year of graduation and appropriate accessors for these variables. Include appropriate constructors for your classes. Then create a separate class with main() method that demonstrates your classes. Use keyword super appropriately.
	
2. Define a class Maximum with the following overloaded static methods 


max (which finds maximum among three integers and returns the maximum integer)
		
max (which finds maximum among three floating point numbers and returns the maximum among them)
		
max (which finds the maximum in an array and returns it)
		
max (which finds the maximum in a matrix and returns the result)
	
Place this in a package called p1. Let this package be present in a folder called “myPackages”, which is a folder in your present working directory (eg: c\student\3rdsem \mypackages\p1). Write a main method to use the methods of Max class in a package p1.


3. Create an abstract class Figure with abstract method area and two integer dimensions. Create three more classes Rectangle, Triangle and Square which extend Figure and implement the area method. Show how the area can be computed dynamically during run time for Rectangle, Square and Triangle to achieve dynamic polymorphism. (Use the reference of Figure class to call the three different area methods)
