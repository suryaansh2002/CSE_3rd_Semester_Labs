## Lab 4

1. Write and simulate the Verilog code for a BCD to Excess 3 code converter using 8 to 1
multiplexers and other necessary gates.


2. Write behavioral Verilog code for a 2 to 4 decoder with active low enable input and active
high output using case statement. Using this, design a 4 to 16 decoder with active low
enable input and active high output and write the Verilog code for the same.


3. Write behavioral Verilog code for 16 to 4 priority encoder using for loop.
