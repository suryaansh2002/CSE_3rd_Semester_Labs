## Lab 5



1. Design and simulate a combinational circuit with external gates and a 4 to 16 decoder built
using a decoder tree of 2 to 4 decoders to implement the functions below.

F= ab’c + a’cd + bcd’ , G=acd’ + a’b’c and H=a’b’c’ + abc + a’cd


2. Design and implement a full adder using 2 to 4 decoder(s) and other gates.


3. Design and simulate the circuit with 3 to 8 decoder(s) and external gates to implement the
functions below.

F(a, b, c, d)= Σm(2,4,7,9) G (a, b, c, d)= Σm (0,3,15) H(a, b, c, d)= Σm(0,2,10,12)
