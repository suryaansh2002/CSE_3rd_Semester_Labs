1. Design and simulate the following counters


a) 4 bit synchronous up counter


b) 3 bit synchronous up/down counter with a control input up/̅𝑑̅𝑜̅̅𝑤̅̅𝑛̅. If up/̅𝑑̅𝑜̅̅𝑤̅̅𝑛̅ = 1, then the circuit should behave as an up counter. If up/̅𝑑̅𝑜̅̅𝑤̅̅𝑛̅ = 0, then the circuit should
behave as a down counter.
